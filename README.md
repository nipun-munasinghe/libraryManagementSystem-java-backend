A simple console-based Library Management System built using Java. This project allows users to manage a collection of books by adding, viewing, borrowing, and returning books.


## Features

- Users can add new books to the library by providing a title and an author.

2. View Books
- Displays all books in the library, along with their availability status.

3. Borrow a Book
- Users can borrow a book by selecting its number, which marks it as unavailable.

4. Return a Book
- Allows users to return a borrowed book, making it available again.

5. Exit
- Exits the application.


## Technologies Used

- **Java:** The project is implemented in Java using classes and objects.
- **ArrayList:** To dynamically manage the collection of books.
- **Scanner:** For user inputs.
